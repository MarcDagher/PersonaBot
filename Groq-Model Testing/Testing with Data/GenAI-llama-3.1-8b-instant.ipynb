      "The big five personality traits, often referred to as OCEAN, and sometimes CANOE, are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These five traits represent broad domains of human behaviour and account for differences in both personality and decision making. Today, the model is used by HR practitioners to evaluate potential employees and marketers to understand the audiences of their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history and development of the traits is long and not without significant challenge. In fact, the earliest known attempt to build a taxonomy of human behaviour dates back to the late 1800s. Between that first investigation and the 1940s, the taxonomy was refined from over 4,000 traits to 171 and eventually 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, psychological and sociological discourse over the next two decades would call into question the validity of any attempt to correlate personality with behaviour. The influential book Personality and Assessment, authored by Walter Mischel , went so far as to suggest that there was only a correlation of 0.3 between personality and behaviour. Mischel argued the case that situational variables had a much greater impact on action than pre-disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet This The Big 5 OCEAN personality traits - openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism - took over 100 years to be narrowed from 4,500 to just five.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1990s, it had been widely accepted that both situational and personality factors affect in-the-moment behaviours. As recently as 2016, research and refinement of the OCEAN model has been ongoing, demonstrating just how influential it is – even to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Big Five Personality Traits\n",
      "\n",
      "Openness to experience. Sometimes called intellect or imagination, this represents the willingness to try new things and think outside the box. Traits include insightfulness, originality and curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conscientiousness. The desire to be careful, diligent and to regulate immediate gratification with self-discipline. Traits include ambition, discipline, consistency and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extroversion. A state where an individual draws energy from others and seeks social connections or interaction, as opposed to being alone (introversion). Traits include being outgoing, energetic and confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agreeableness The measure of how an individual interacts with others, characterised by degree of compassion and co-operation. Traits include tactfulness, kindness and loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neuroticism. A tendency towards negative personality traits, emotional instability and self-destructive thinking. Traits include pessimism, anxiety, insecurity and fearfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the Model is Used Today\n",
      "\n",
      "The OCEAN model is best thought of as a series of interconnected scales. Everyone will sit somewhere on each scale, but tests that use the OCEAN framework aim to determine the degree to which an individual shows the traits covered by each of the domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many organisations use employee scores to determine cultural fit, in addition to building teams that have similar or complimentary personality traits. Some even take this a step further by providing staff with a summary of their results and advice on how best to communicate with employees with different personality types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of HR departments, marketers are the most frequent users of the OCEAN framework. Often combined with demographic or other targeting factors, the model is used to help understand audiences and what will likely appeal to them based on the commonalities within their personality profiles. Much has been written about subsets of personality types that marketers can target, in addition to strategies for doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debates and Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Big Five represent the prevailing theory of personality, the model is not without its challenges. The most significant is simply the fast changing nature of the discourse around topics of the self, identity and personality. Additionally, there is no single consensus on how to assess an individual based on the OCEAN framework. The most well accepted is the NEO PI assessment, which has been three times since its initial inception in the late 1970s. However, there are also NEO FFR and NEO PI-R assessments which offer variations on assessment tactic.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more direct challenge that researchers and marketers face is that assessing personality types is a lengthy process. Even the shortest accepted assessment – the NEO FFI – asks individuals to rate 60 items on a 5-point scale. This drawn out process makes it difficult to put the OCEAN framework to use on a regular basis. But that is not to say the model does not add value when it can be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet This The most significant challenges researchers must overcome to make full use of the OCEAN framework is finding a succinct way to assess consumers without lengthy, un-engaging surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing in Greenbook, Brooke Patton highlights recent examples from GutCheck that apply the Big Five personality traits to consumer research. By including personality assessments, the agency found that the favourable audience of a brand’s new product concept also scored high on the agreeableness scale. The result highlighted the messages and communications that the brand should use in order to reach their target audience in a positive way.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a literature review of studies into The Big Five and their applications in marketing from The University of Vienna points out some of the reasons for marketers and researchers alike to be cautious. Notably:\n",
      "\n",
      "Personality traits do not take into consideration cross-cultural or demographic differences in behaviour\n",
      "\n",
      "The OCEAN framework is a simplification of a complex topic and should never be used without a hint of caution\n",
      "\n",
      "The theory of personality traits and assessment methods are frequently changing, making choice of methodology is important\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while there are – as with most measures – both advantages and limitations to The Big Five personality traits, they still represent the most coherent and researched model of personality that has been devised to date. With careful planning and a clear understanding of how they will inform research, the OCEAN model can add a huge amount of value to brands’ understanding of their audiences.\n",

      "\n",
      "What do I want to achieve with my work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing meaningful work? Doesn't everyone want that? But what does meaningful work actually entail? What do I want to achieve with my work? There is a good chance that everyone interprets meaningful work as something different. Some want to improve the world, others are looking for independence, or mainly want to be creative. Meaningful work says something about your work values.\n",
      "\n",
      "9 work values\n",
      "\n",
      "Below are nine statements about the meaning of the work. Which one can you answer with a resounding \"yes\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I would like to become a millionaire\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretly, many people do want to become millionaires. This is evident from the fact that millions of lottery tickets are sold every month. Wealth gives status, freedom, and the opportunity to help other people. But unfortunately the chances of winning the jackpot in a lottery are very small. To become a millionaire, you would be better off starting your own company and making it a great success. But this requires a lot of perseverance and also a little luck. Perhaps there are work values other than wealth that you also find important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I want to be able to do my own thing\n",
      "\n",
      "Freedom is a strong work value for many people. The bottom line is that you like to go your own way. The reasons for this can vary greatly. Some people have always been set on having their own freedom. Because they might, for instance, have many hobbies in addition to working. The need for freedom can also be very important in a certain phase of life. Consider the parents of young children or if you need time to care for a family member. The need for freedom therefore partly determines whether you will work for an organisation where, for example, you can work from home a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. I want to make the world a better place\n",
      "\n",
      "You can improve the world in many ways. This can be achieved by helping and caring for others. In education or healthcare, for example. But you can also work in a more activistic way. By fighting poverty for instance, or helping people in war-torn regions. Consider a position with an organisation such as Greenpeace or Doctors without Borders. By working on improving the world you won't get rich quickly. You mostly get satisfaction from the fact that by your actions you make the world a little bit fairer or nicer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I want to be really good at something\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people find it important to be really good at something. They derive much satisfaction from being addressed as an expert or contributing with their knowledge or skills. It doesn't necessarily have to be the position you studied for at university. As plumber, dietitian, or mechanic, people are also dependent on your expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. I am looking for security and stability\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this is not very sexy or appealing. But this is an important work value for many people. And there is nothing wrong with striving for security. A permanent contract provides peace of mind. And that also includes things like a good retirement provision or sufficient savings. For many people security is a big driver when choosing a direction of study or in what kind of employer they choose. They would prefer to choose an education in which job security is high and subsequently choose to work for the government since that provides the biggest chance of a job for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. I want to be around people\n",
      "\n",
      "There are people who need to be around people. They are the extroverts among us. They get energised through contact with others. As sales person, teacher, or team leader for example. People with this work value are not likely to work at home. They would much rather be with colleagues, loves client contact, or prefers working with friends. For them, choosing a career is determined by whether they will have enough contact with people.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. I want the opposite of an office job\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people just can't sit still and are therefore completely unsuited to an office job where you spend a lot of time behind a computer. Luckily there are enough jobs for people who are not suited to an office job. For these jobs you can think of work where you are driving, working with your hands, operating machinery, are outside a lot, or working with animals. People with this work value can therefore end up in many different positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. I want to be the boss\n",
      "\n",
      "You know these people. People who prefer to be in control. They don't always have to be the nasty types. Some people naturally take the lead. For example, as captain of a sports team or board member in a social association. People with this work value like to take responsibility or struggle with having a boss. Or a bit of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. I want to be creative\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people always have good ideas. Wanting to be creative doesn't always mean being good at painting or acting. Wanting to be creative mean that you want to work somewhere where you can use your imagination. For instance, for developing or improving services or products. But you can also use your creativity in sales and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which work values suit me?\n",
      "\n",
      "One work value doesn't have to exclude another. It is even more likely that you have more than one value to work. In this way, a combination of work values can also be very decisive for the work environment or position that you will aspire to. Do you not have a clear preference, do many work values appeal to you? Then take the career motivation test and discover which work values you really find important and which careers go hand in hand with that.\n",

      "\n",
      "The goal of this free career aptitude test is to help everyone, from lowly to highly-skilled workers and from young to older workers, choose their preferred career path in an inspiring and unique way: whether you’ve just completed school, have been dismissed, are in the midst of a reorganisation or are simply looking for something new. The reason for why this aptitude test is completely free is because the results and overview of professions include advertisements.\n",

      "Before you fill out the questionnaire, you'll be asked whether you choose images with a man or woman. Your choice will determine whether you complete the men or women’s version of the questionnaire. It’s been proven that many people prefer to see someone of their own gender practice a certain activity or occupation. In addition, questionnaires with images depicting both men and women often express certain stereotypes. Naturally, a questionnaire including only pictures of men or women solves this problem. And for those who don’t want to choose between man of female, there is the option of no preference.\n",

      "The questionnaire consists of images in the form of cartoons. Images prevent you from having to fill out long and word-heavy questionnaires. As a result, this will keep people involved and allow them to experience the test as more of a game. Given the serious nature of this game, one could refer to this type of questionnaire as a form of ‘serious gaming’. In addition, with images, test-takers are able to visualize activities or professions better, making for a richer experience. Every image depicts a profession or activity and, for clarity, is provided with a word or series of words to further clarify the profession or activity. In theory, someone should be able to complete the test without this explanation. The questionnaire is therefore also suitable for people who are dyslexic or who do not fully master the English language (yet).\n",

      "The big five personality traits, often referred to as OCEAN, and sometimes CANOE, are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These five traits represent broad domains of human behaviour and account for differences in both personality and decision making. Today, the model is used by HR practitioners to evaluate potential employees and marketers to understand the audiences of their products.\n",
      "The history and development of the traits is long and not without significant challenge. In fact, the earliest known attempt to build a taxonomy of human behaviour dates back to the late 1800s. Between that first investigation and the 1940s, the taxonomy was refined from over 4,000 traits to 171 and eventually 5.\n",
      "However, psychological and sociological discourse over the next two decades would call into question the validity of any attempt to correlate personality with behaviour. The influential book Personality and Assessment, authored by Walter Mischel , went so far as to suggest that there was only a correlation of 0.3 between personality and behaviour. Mischel argued the case that situational variables had a much greater impact on action than pre-disposition.\n",
      "Tweet This The Big 5 OCEAN personality traits - openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism - took over 100 years to be narrowed from 4,500 to just five.\n",
      "By the 1990s, it had been widely accepted that both situational and personality factors affect in-the-moment behaviours. As recently as 2016, research and refinement of the OCEAN model has been ongoing, demonstrating just how influential it is – even to this day.\n",
      "The Big Five Personality Traits\n",
      "Openness to experience. Sometimes called intellect or imagination, this represents the willingness to try new things and think outside the box. Traits include insightfulness, originality and curiosity.\n",
      "Conscientiousness. The desire to be careful, diligent and to regulate immediate gratification with self-discipline. Traits include ambition, discipline, consistency and reliability.\n",
      "Extroversion. A state where an individual draws energy from others and seeks social connections or interaction, as opposed to being alone (introversion). Traits include being outgoing, energetic and confident.\n",
      "Agreeableness The measure of how an individual interacts with others, characterised by degree of compassion and co-operation. Traits include tactfulness, kindness and loyalty.\n",
      "Neuroticism. A tendency towards negative personality traits, emotional instability and self-destructive thinking. Traits include pessimism, anxiety, insecurity and fearfulness.\n",
      "How the Model is Used Today\n",
      "The OCEAN model is best thought of as a series of interconnected scales. Everyone will sit somewhere on each scale, but tests that use the OCEAN framework aim to determine the degree to which an individual shows the traits covered by each of the domains.\n",
      "Many organisations use employee scores to determine cultural fit, in addition to building teams that have similar or complimentary personality traits. Some even take this a step further by providing staff with a summary of their results and advice on how best to communicate with employees with different personality types.\n",
      "Outside of HR departments, marketers are the most frequent users of the OCEAN framework. Often combined with demographic or other targeting factors, the model is used to help understand audiences and what will likely appeal to them based on the commonalities within their personality profiles. Much has been written about subsets of personality types that marketers can target, in addition to strategies for doing so.\n",
      "Debates and Challenges\n",
      "While the Big Five represent the prevailing theory of personality, the model is not without its challenges. The most significant is simply the fast changing nature of the discourse around topics of the self, identity and personality. Additionally, there is no single consensus on how to assess an individual based on the OCEAN framework. The most well accepted is the NEO PI assessment, which has been three times since its initial inception in the late 1970s. However, there are also NEO FFR and NEO PI-R assessments which offer variations on assessment tactic.\n",
      "A more direct challenge that researchers and marketers face is that assessing personality types is a lengthy process. Even the shortest accepted assessment – the NEO FFI – asks individuals to rate 60 items on a 5-point scale. This drawn out process makes it difficult to put the OCEAN framework to use on a regular basis. But that is not to say the model does not add value when it can be implemented.\n",
      "Tweet This The most significant challenges researchers must overcome to make full use of the OCEAN framework is finding a succinct way to assess consumers without lengthy, un-engaging surveys.\n",
      "Writing in Greenbook, Brooke Patton highlights recent examples from GutCheck that apply the Big Five personality traits to consumer research. By including personality assessments, the agency found that the favourable audience of a brand’s new product concept also scored high on the agreeableness scale. The result highlighted the messages and communications that the brand should use in order to reach their target audience in a positive way.\n",
      "On the other hand, a literature review of studies into The Big Five and their applications in marketing from The University of Vienna points out some of the reasons for marketers and researchers alike to be cautious. Notably:\n",
      "Personality traits do not take into consideration cross-cultural or demographic differences in behaviour\n",
      "The OCEAN framework is a simplification of a complex topic and should never be used without a hint of caution\n",
      "The theory of personality traits and assessment methods are frequently changing, making choice of methodology is important\n",
      "In summary, while there are – as with most measures – both advantages and limitations to The Big Five personality traits, they still represent the most coherent and researched model of personality that has been devised to date. With careful planning and a clear understanding of how they will inform research, the OCEAN model can add a huge amount of value to brands’ understanding of their audiences.\n",

      "What do I want to achieve with my work?\n",
      "Doing meaningful work? Doesn't everyone want that? But what does meaningful work actually entail? What do I want to achieve with my work? There is a good chance that everyone interprets meaningful work as something different. Some want to improve the world, others are looking for independence, or mainly want to be creative. Meaningful work says something about your work values.\n",
      "9 work values\n",
      "Below are nine statements about the meaning of the work. Which one can you answer with a resounding \"yes\"?\n",
      "1. I would like to become a millionaire\n",
      "Secretly, many people do want to become millionaires. This is evident from the fact that millions of lottery tickets are sold every month. Wealth gives status, freedom, and the opportunity to help other people. But unfortunately the chances of winning the jackpot in a lottery are very small. To become a millionaire, you would be better off starting your own company and making it a great success. But this requires a lot of perseverance and also a little luck. Perhaps there are work values other than wealth that you also find important.\n",
      "2. I want to be able to do my own thing\n",
      "Freedom is a strong work value for many people. The bottom line is that you like to go your own way. The reasons for this can vary greatly. Some people have always been set on having their own freedom. Because they might, for instance, have many hobbies in addition to working. The need for freedom can also be very important in a certain phase of life. Consider the parents of young children or if you need time to care for a family member. The need for freedom therefore partly determines whether you will work for an organisation where, for example, you can work from home a lot.\n",
      "3. I want to make the world a better place\n",
      "You can improve the world in many ways. This can be achieved by helping and caring for others. In education or healthcare, for example. But you can also work in a more activistic way. By fighting poverty for instance, or helping people in war-torn regions. Consider a position with an organisation such as Greenpeace or Doctors without Borders. By working on improving the world you won't get rich quickly. You mostly get satisfaction from the fact that by your actions you make the world a little bit fairer or nicer.\n",
      "4. I want to be really good at something\n",
      "Some people find it important to be really good at something. They derive much satisfaction from being addressed as an expert or contributing with their knowledge or skills. It doesn't necessarily have to be the position you studied for at university. As plumber, dietitian, or mechanic, people are also dependent on your expertise.\n",
      "5. I am looking for security and stability\n",
      "Perhaps this is not very sexy or appealing. But this is an important work value for many people. And there is nothing wrong with striving for security. A permanent contract provides peace of mind. And that also includes things like a good retirement provision or sufficient savings. For many people security is a big driver when choosing a direction of study or in what kind of employer they choose. They would prefer to choose an education in which job security is high and subsequently choose to work for the government since that provides the biggest chance of a job for life.\n",
      "6. I want to be around people\n",
      "There are people who need to be around people. They are the extroverts among us. They get energised through contact with others. As sales person, teacher, or team leader for example. People with this work value are not likely to work at home. They would much rather be with colleagues, loves client contact, or prefers working with friends. For them, choosing a career is determined by whether they will have enough contact with people.\n",
      "7. I want the opposite of an office job\n",
      "Some people just can't sit still and are therefore completely unsuited to an office job where you spend a lot of time behind a computer. Luckily there are enough jobs for people who are not suited to an office job. For these jobs you can think of work where you are driving, working with your hands, operating machinery, are outside a lot, or working with animals. People with this work value can therefore end up in many different positions.\n",
      "8. I want to be the boss\n",
      "You know these people. People who prefer to be in control. They don't always have to be the nasty types. Some people naturally take the lead. For example, as captain of a sports team or board member in a social association. People with this work value like to take responsibility or struggle with having a boss. Or a bit of both.\n",
      "9. I want to be creative\n",
      "Some people always have good ideas. Wanting to be creative doesn't always mean being good at painting or acting. Wanting to be creative mean that you want to work somewhere where you can use your imagination. For instance, for developing or improving services or products. But you can also use your creativity in sales and marketing.\n",
      "Which work values suit me?\n",
      "One work value doesn't have to exclude another. It is even more likely that you have more than one value to work. In this way, a combination of work values can also be very decisive for the work environment or position that you will aspire to. Do you not have a clear preference, do many work values appeal to you? Then take the career motivation test and discover which work values you really find important and which careers go hand in hand with that.\n",

      "Why is this career aptitude test free?\n",
      "The goal of this free career aptitude test is to help everyone, from lowly to highly-skilled workers and from young to older workers, choose their preferred career path in an inspiring and unique way: whether you’ve just completed school, have been dismissed, are in the midst of a reorganisation or are simply looking for something new. The reason for why this aptitude test is completely free is because the results and overview of professions include advertisements.\n",
      "Career aptitude test for men and women\n",
      "Before you fill out the questionnaire, you'll be asked whether you choose images with a man or woman. Your choice will determine whether you complete the men or women’s version of the questionnaire. It’s been proven that many people prefer to see someone of their own gender practice a certain activity or occupation. In addition, questionnaires with images depicting both men and women often express certain stereotypes. Naturally, a questionnaire including only pictures of men or women solves this problem. And for those who don’t want to choose between man of female, there is the option of no preference.\n",
      "Non-verbal career quiz, serious gaming for career choice\n",
      "The questionnaire consists of images in the form of cartoons. Images prevent you from having to fill out long and word-heavy questionnaires. As a result, this will keep people involved and allow them to experience the test as more of a game. Given the serious nature of this game, one could refer to this type of questionnaire as a form of ‘serious gaming’. In addition, with images, test-takers are able to visualize activities or professions better, making for a richer experience. Every image depicts a profession or activity and, for clarity, is provided with a word or series of words to further clarify the profession or activity. In theory, someone should be able to complete the test without this explanation. The questionnaire is therefore also suitable for people who are dyslexic or who do not fully master the English language (yet).\n",
      "Finding appropriate professions\n",
      "The report of this vocational test reflects your score on six personality traits related to career choice. These six personality traits are based on the most popular career choice model, the so-called RIASEC model. Your report will include example professions, both for lower and higher levels of education. The report will also explain why certain professions do or do not suit your personality. For each profession you can find more information about the chance of robotization, current vacancies and salary in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Career test with printable report\n",
      "After completing the questionnaire, you get the free results. Every report of the career test is printable or can be downloaded as a PDF.\n",

      "Fast language models are a recent innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have gained significant attention in the research community. The importance of fast language models can be understood from several aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scalability**: Traditional language models are often computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and memory to train and deploy. Fast language models aim to reduce the computational overhead, allowing for faster inference and greater scalability.\n",
      "2. **Efficient inference**: Fast language models enable fast text generation, translation, and other NLP tasks, making them suitable for real-time applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and text summarization.\n",
      "3. **Hardware acceleration**: Fast language models can take advantage of specialized hardware accelerators like TPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, which significantly improve the training and inference speed.\n",
      "4. **Improved performance**: By reducing the computational overhead, fast language models can maintain or even improve the performance of the underlying model, often with minimal sacrifice in accuracy.\n",
      "5. **Enabling new applications**: The speed and efficiency of fast language models open up possibilities for new applications and use cases that were previously not feasible due to performance constraints.\n",
      "6. **Reducing latency**: Fast language models reduce the latency associated with model-inference, making them suitable for applications where low latency is essential, such as:\n",
      "\t* Real-time chatbots\n",
      "\t* Virtual assistants\n",
      "\t* Text-to-speech systems\n",
      "\t* Predictive text input\n",
      "7. **Wide deployment**: The reduced computational overhead of fast language models makes them deployable on a wider range of devices, including low-power endpoints, mobile devices, and IoT devices.\n",
      "8. **Real-world impact**: By enabling efficient language understanding and generation, fast language models can have a significant impact on real-world applications, such as:\n",
      "\t* Decision-making systems\n",
      "\t* Customer service chatbots\n",
      "\t* Healthcare diagnosis and treatment planning\n",
      "\t* Translation services\n",
      "\t* Content generation\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of fast language models has sparked significant research in the NLP community, with various approaches being proposed to improve speed and efficiency, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Model pruning and quantization\n",
      "* Knowledge distillation\n",
      "* Model compression\n",
      "* Hardware acceleration\n",
      "* Approximate computing\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of fast language models looks promising, with continued advancements in hardware and software technologies, as well as innovative approaches to model optimization and efficient inference.\n"
