      "1. **Non-maleficence**: The principle of \"do no harm\" or, at the very least, minimize harm to the patient.\n",
      "2. **Beneficence**: The principle of acting in the best interests of the patient, which includes promoting their health, well-being, and dignity.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Utilitarian perspective:**\n",
      "From a purely utilitarian standpoint, it might seem logical to prioritize the young patient who has a higher likelihood of survival and contributing to society in the long run. This perspective focuses on maximizing overall happiness and well-being, which could justify allocating the heart to the younger patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Deontological perspective:**\n",
      "However, from a deontological perspective, which emphasizes the importance of respecting individual rights and dignity, the decision becomes more complicated. The 92-year-old patient has the right to autonomy, dignity, and respect, regardless of their age or condition. Turning off their life support without their explicit consent (or that of their proxy decision-maker) would be a violation of their autonomy and dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Principle of justice:**\n",
      "The principle of justice dictates that scarce resources (in this case, the heart) should be allocated fairly and without bias. However, this principle alone cannot provide a clear answer, as it depends on how one weighs the competing interests of the two patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Beneficence and non-maleficence:**\n",
      "The principles of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (doing no harm) are also relevant. Beneficence would suggest prioritizing the young patient, as they have a higher chance of survival and a longer life expectancy. Non-maleficence would caution against actively causing the death of the 92-year-old patient by turning off their life support.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clinical and legal considerations:**\n",
      "In most countries, it is illegal to actively end a patient's life, even if they are in a terminal condition. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment must be made in accordance with the patient's advance directive, living will, or the proxy decision-maker's wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ethical framework:**\n",
      "When dealing with such complex decisions, it's essential to consider a comprehensive ethical framework that incorporates multiple principles and perspectives. A possible framework could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Respecting the autonomy of both patients\n",
      "2. Assessing the likelihood of survival and quality of life for each patient\n",
      "3. Considering the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice\n",
      "4. Engaging in open and transparent communication with the patients, their families, and the healthcare team\n",
      "5. Involving ethics committees or consultants to provide additional guidance and support\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "In this scenario, it is not ethically justifiable to actively turn off the 92-year-old patient's life support without their explicit consent or the proxy decision-maker's authorization. Instead, the healthcare team should focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Providing appropriate palliative care to the 92-year-old patient, ensuring their comfort and dignity.\n",
      "2. Assessing the young patient's condition and exploring alternative options for obtaining a heart transplant, such as waitlisting or seeking alternative donor sources.\n",
      "3. Engaging in open and transparent communication with both patients, their families, and the healthcare team to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and involved in the decision-making process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the decision to allocate the heart transplant should be made in accordance with ethical guidelines, legal frameworks, and the principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.\n"
